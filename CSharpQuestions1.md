5.
Q: What is the purpose of using statement?
A: The purpose of a using statement is to add a namespace.

6.
Q: What are dynamic type variables?
A: It allows the operations to "bypass compile-time type checking."

7.
Q: What is the purpose of the is operator?
A: To check if an object is compatible with a type.

8.
Q: What are generics and how is using them useful?
A: They give you the ability of defining classes and methods.

A: You can "assign normal range of values as well as null values."

13.
Q: What is an enumeration?
A: A set of constants.

14.

17.
Q: What is an object?
A: It is an instance if a dynamic class.

18.
Q: What is the difference between a struct and a class?
A: A struct is a value type and a class is a reference type.

19.
Q: What is the difference between continue and break statements?
A: Continue will continue a loop and break will break out of a loop.

20.
Q: What is this and how is it used?
A: It is the current instance of a class.

21.
Q: What is try and catch and when are they used?
A: Try and catch are to handle an exception, Try is used until an exception is thrown and catch is there to handle those exceptions.

22.
Q: How is exception handling done?

23.
Q: What is finally and what is its purpose?
A: Finally is used in try catch as a final outcome no matter if there is an exception or not.

24.

A: In an ArrayList, you can increase or decrease the size dynamically opposed to an Array. Also, an array cannot accept null while an ArrayList can.

25.
Q: What is an object?
A: It is an occurance of a dynamic class.

26.
Q: Define constructor.
A: It is a method of a class.

27.
Q: When can var be used to declare a variable and how is the type for the variable determined?
A: Var can be used when it is a local variable and you initialize it in the same statement.

28.
Q: What is an abstract class?

29.
Q: What is an interface?
A: It declares methods.

30.
Q: What is a method?
A: A method are statements that are grouped together to perform.

31.
Q: What is a property?
A: They are "named members of classes, structures, and interfaces."

32.
Q: What is an access specifier?
A: Access Specifiers are in place to give certain accesses to types and members.

33.
Q: What access specifiers are supported and what do they mean?
A: Public - it gives access to any code, Private - only accessed by code in the same struct or class, Protected - only in the same class or sublclass, Internal - Any code in that is in the same assembly, Protected Internal - Any code in any assembly, and Private Protected - Only in the assembly that declares it, same class, or a type that is from the same class.

34.
Q: What is a collection?
A: A collection holds a set of classes.

35.
